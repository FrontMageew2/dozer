== 3rd Party Object Factories
Dozer supports mapping of plain Java objects to frameworks that require
instantiation of objects via certain convention of calling factory
methods. To reproduce the expected behavior custom bean factories should
be used.

=== Mapping JAXB Objects
Dozer has support for mapping POJOs to JAXB objects. Use the
JAXBBeanFactory for any JAXB objects you want create.
